    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Home-style tacos al pastor (chile and pineapple pork tacos) are a favorite in Mexico and Mexican restaurants throughout the world for good reason: The mixture of smoky, spicy chiles, sweet pineapples, fresh onions, and cilantro is taco perfection. Traditionally, tacos al pastor are made by marinating pork in chile sauce, layering the meat on a vertical rotisserie, adorning it with a pineapple, and roasting it slowly for hoursâ€”a process that's almost impossible to replicate at home. So we've taken the delicious, authentic flavors that make these tacos so special and adapted the recipe for your home kitchen so you can enjoy it whenever a craving strikes!
